Elm-Sokoban
===========

This is a basic sokoban clone written in Elm.  This is only a learning exercise, so
don't expect too much.

The goal is to have a nice, well structured, codebase written in Elm.  

Gameplay
--------
The goal of the game is to move all the crates on their assigned spot.  The game is
really simple, just use arrows to move your character and press escape if you need
to reset the current level if you are stuck.

To do
-----
Some nice to have features.  Who knows, I might get bored and implement a few of
them.

* add a main menu (?) with reset, select level, high scores, ...
* animation: when the character moves, it would be nice if there was a short (200ms?)
  animation displayed
* better graphic: the blue circle could be better (and look like a human?)
* add a high score feature, and save it to local storage
* scalable graphics: tile width could depend on the current level and the context
